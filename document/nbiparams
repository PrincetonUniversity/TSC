Parameters that need to be set for NUBEAM besides those in the Machine Description File:

ps%nbeam                      # of beams
  ps%kvolt_nbi(1:ps%nbeam)    voltage
  ps%power_nbi(1:ps%nbeam)    power
  ps%nbion(1:ps%nbeam)        name of species injected by beam(H,D,T,He3,He4)


ps%nspec_beam                 # of types of beam species
  ps%qatom_snbi(1:nspec_beam) atomic number of beam species
  ps%q_snbi(1:nspec_beam)     charge of beam species
  ps%m_snbi(1:nspec_beam)     mass of beam species
      (above 3 are set by "ps_species_convert")
  ps%nbeami(1:nspec_beam,1:nhro) density of beam species


ps%nspec_th                   # of thermal species
  ps%qatom_s(1:nspec_th) atomic number of thermal species
  ps%q_s(1:nspec_th)     charge of thermal species
  ps%m_s(1:nspec_th)     mass of thermal species
      (above 3 are set by "ps_species_convert")
  ps%ts                       temperature
  ps%ns                       density
  ps%vpars                    parallel velocity

Note that for each beam injected fast specie (one or mor of H,D,T,He3,He4)
there must be a matching thermal specie.   So, if D is in the list of beam
species 1:ps%nspec_beam, it must also be in the list of thermal species
1:ps%nspec_th.


also need:
ps%te        electron temperature
ps%ti        ion temperature
ps%ne        electron density
ps%zeff
ps%zeff_th
ps%nhe       helium density
ps%nhy       hydrogen density
ps%frac_h    fraction of ps%nhy that is H
ps%frac_d      "      "    "     "   "  D
ps%frac_t      "      "    "     "   "  T

NOTE:  The quasi-neutrality condition must be satisfied, including the beam particles.
this implies that:

ne = sum(nspec_th)[q_s * ns] + sum(nspec_beam)[q_snbi * nbeami]
     We must obtain nbeami(nspec_beam,nrho) from the plasma state

In the TSC input:   acoef(4955)   acoef(113)
for H  plasma           1.0          0.0
for D  plasma           0.0          1.0
for DT plasma           0.0          0.5

ambeam  (on type 25)
       = 1 for H beam, 
         2 for D beam, and 
         3 for T beam
